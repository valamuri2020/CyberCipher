##### I'm nearly finished with the project and am finalizing the shift algorithm to account for inputs that exceed 26. I plan to use the modulus operator on the shift input to keep it within range and act as if the shift was under 26. For example, A shifted by 27 would be the same as A shifter by 1 because 27 % 26 = 1.

#### This app will be deployed to the web using Heroku very soon!

##### If you find any bugs that were not caught during development, please open an issue so we can work on resolving it. I strive to make my work as best as possible.

#### Thank you for viewing my project,
